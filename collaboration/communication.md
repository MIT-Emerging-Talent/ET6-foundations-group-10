## Asking for Help

Here’s a general guide for when to ask for help if you’re stuck:

1. **0 -> 30 minutes**: Try solving the problem independently using available resources.
2. **30 -> 60 minutes**: Reach out to the group via Slack for input or support.
3. **60+ minutes**: If still unresolved, tag a coach or mentor on Slack or GitHub.

### Key Note

Don’t hesitate to ask for help when needed. Collaboration is about supporting each other to achieve the project goals.

## Meeting Agendas

Meeting agendas will be created before each scheduled meeting:

- Agendas are drafted using GitHub Issues, where members can add discussion points.
- Meeting minutes and action items are recorded and shared in the issue comments or via Slack.
- All agenda points are addressed before closing the meeting issue.
