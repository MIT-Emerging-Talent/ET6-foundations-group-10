## Stop Doing

- **Challenges Faced:**
  - Initial difficulties in understanding the complete GitHub workflow.
  - Errors during the push process from local machines to GitHub, such as merge conflicts or incomplete changes.
  - Limited initial familiarity with GitHub’s collaborative features, leading to delays in resolving issues.

*Takeaway:* Invest more time in understanding GitHub tools and workflows at the start of the project to minimize errors and delays.

---

## Continue Doing

- **What Worked Well:**
  - Collaborative problem-solving improved over time, especially during CI/CD checks and error resolution.
  - Regular document reviews and feedback fostered team learning and improved overall quality.
  - Clear documentation and communication in Slack channels helped the team address challenges effectively.

*Takeaway:* Continue building on strong collaboration and communication practices.

---

## Start Doing

- **New Ideas for Future Projects:**
  - Document the step-by-step GitHub workflow for all team members to refer to during the project.
  - Establish a shared resource for documenting common errors and solutions (e.g., troubleshooting merge conflicts or CI errors).
  - Schedule regular review sessions to identify errors earlier in the project lifecycle.

*Takeaway:* Implement these strategies to ensure a smoother and more efficient workflow in future projects.
