# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

---

## **External**

<!-- constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over: -->

- **Deadline:** The project must be completed by **10 Jan 2025**.
- **Programming Language:** The programming language for this project is **Python** and cannot be changed.
- **Coding Standards:** All coding, documentation, and reviews must adhere to established standards and examples.
- **Restricted Pushes:** Direct pushes to the main branch are prohibited.
- **Branch Merging Rules:** Branches can only be merged after a pull request is reviewed and approved.
- **Team Size:** The team consists of 10 members. However, active participation will be observed throughout the process, and adjustments will be made as needed to ensure tasks are distributed effectively and project goals are met. This flexible approach allows the team to adapt based on member availability and engagement.

## **Internal: Involuntary**

<!-- constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over: -->

- **Different Schedules:** Team members have varying commitments, making synchronous meetings difficult.
- **Learning Together:** Some members are still learning relevant skills, requiring collaboration and support.
- **Limited Availability:** Balancing this project with other responsibilities might reduce availability at times.
- **Knowledge Gaps:** Some members lack experience in specific technologies or concepts, which may slow progress.
- **Dependency on Others:** Certain tasks depend on the completion of others, potentially causing bottlenecks.
- **Limited Review Capacity:** Fewer reviewers might delay pull request approvals and overall progress.

## **Internal: Voluntary**

<!-- constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. -->

- **Scope Management:** The project scope is deliberately kept small to ensure timely completion and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Adherence to Rules:** The team agrees to follow coding style guides, documentation standards, and review conventions.
- **Collaboration Commitment:** All members are dedicated to equal participation and supporting one another.
- **Documentation Priority:** All tasks, decisions, and code will be properly documented to facilitate collaboration.
